It is a game that was built to practice local, session storage and the use of sounds on the application.

I used a more detailed approach with structure so the code has more sections with the names of the functions being more directive about what they do.

## How to play

1. Start the game by clicking on the start button
2. The user will be given a random word
3. The user will be given 99 seconds to type as many words as possible
4. The user will be able to see their current score and high score at the end of the game
5. The user will also be able to see a history of their scores by clicking on the scoreboard button

## Technologies Used:

 HTML: Structured the layout and content of the game.
 CSS: Styled the visual elements and made the game visually appealing.
 JavaScript: Implemented the game logic, including word generation, input validation, scoring, and timer functionality.
 LocalStorage: Stored high scores locally on the player's device to persist across sessions.
 SessionStorage: Stored temporary game data, such as the current word and remaining time, to maintain game state during gameplay.

## Features:

1. Typing Challenge: Players are presented with a random word and must type it correctly to score points.
2. Countdown Timer: The game features a countdown timer to add urgency and excitement to the gameplay.
3. Scoreboard: A scoreboard keeps track of the highest scores achieved by players, encouraging competition and replayability.
4. Sound Effects: The game includes sound effects for typing, game over, and countdown, enhancing the gaming experience.
5. Responsive Design: The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring compatibility with different screen sizes and devices.
